<p>We used a Wikipedia training dataset, processed the data and created new features to use for training a model.</p>

<p>In our original project we were able to train a RandomForest model with the features in the dataset above with n=1000. The size of this model and resources available prevented
  us from using this model on this webapp. So in the form below, we are using n=10 of a RandomForest model with similar other parameters. This will reduce accuracy but for
the purpose of showing its purpose and function, n=10 will have to suffice. </p>
<p class="text-muted">RandomForest with n=10  had a score of 0.97 on training data and 0.73 on test</p>
