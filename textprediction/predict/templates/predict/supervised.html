<p>We used wikipedia training dataset, processed the data and created new features to use for training a model. If you would like to explore the features and create some Visualizations
  you can visit our <a href="https://supervised-text-readability.herokuapp.com/supervised_cleaned/supervised_readability">heroku app </a>
</p>
<p>We used <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> to allow for exploration and sharing our data with others.</p>

<h3 class="pb-3">Text Difficulty Prediction: Try for yourself</h3>
<p>In our original project we were able to train a RandomForest model with the features in the dataset above with n=1000. The size of this model and resoruces available prevented
  us from using this model on this webapp. So in the form below, we are using n=10 of a RandomForest model with similar other parameters. This will reduce accuracy but for
the purpose of showing its purpose and function, n=10 will have to suffice. </p>
<p class="text-muted">RandomForest with n=10  had a score of 0.97 on training data and 0.70 on test</p>
